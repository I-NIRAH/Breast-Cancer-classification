# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning (Google Colab)
  This project classifies whether a tumor is benign or malignant using machine learning algorithms on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset. The goal is to aid early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

## Project Description

This simple machine learning project:
- Uses the built-in **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** from `scikit-learn`.
- Explores and visualizes the dataset.
- Trains classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Is fully executable in **Google Colab** â€” no setup needed!

## How to Run the Project

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook** 
      [Click here to open the Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cIVm58u4t1GB7cFWdVikMZ99T3HoWNB2?usp=sharing)  
   
2. **Run All Cells**  
   - Load data (no CSV file needed â€” it's loaded directly from `sklearn.datasets`)
   - Preprocess and split the dataset
   - Train the model
   - View evaluation metrics and predictions

Everything runs in the cloud. No installation or uploads required.

## Sample Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (optional)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
